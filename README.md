## üß† Abstract

Computer vision has been a difficult subject of research for many years, but
over the past decade, it is steadily becoming more and more powerful as new
approaches are developed, which bring us closer to truly creating vision that is both
highly efficient and accurate.</p>  

However, in order to achieve this, we must further
develop computer vision to mimic that of humans, by relaying sensory inputs to the
brain. By using artificial intelligence and neural networks in computer vision, we can
see some incredible future applications of this technology to benefit society. </p>
  
This research paper is intended to delve deeper into computer vision and explore why
artificial intelligence and neural networking is crucial for object detection, how it is
utilized, and what the future for it looks like in our ever-changing world.</p>
